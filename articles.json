However, Debian's packaging rules do not\nrequire developers to explicitly declare dependencies on that set of\npackages (the essential set) but they can simply rely on the fact that those\nwill always be present. That means that changing the essential set, as\nthe project may wish to do occasionally, is more complicated than it\nshould be. This came to light recently when a Debian developer asked\nwhat might be required to remove &lt;a\nhref=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/mawk\"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;mawk&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to slim down\nthe project's container images.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t", "<item xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n\t\t\t<title>LWN.net Weekly Edition for May 15, 2025</title>\n\t\t\t<link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1020448/</link>\n\t\t\t<guid>https://lwn.net/Articles/1020448/</guid>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>corbet</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<description>Inside this week's LWN.net Weekly Edition:\n        &lt;p&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1020448/\"&gt;Front&lt;/a&gt;: Home Assistant; YaST; bpfilter; Flatpak; More LSFMM+BPF 2025 coverage.\n            &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1020450/\"&gt;Briefs&lt;/a&gt;: Screen security; Guix on Codeberg; Postgres I/O; GNOME executive director; Nextcloud blog; Podman 5.5.0; OSL sustainability; Quotes; ...\n            &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1020451/\"&gt;Announcements&lt;/a&gt;: Newsletters, conferences, security updates, patches, and more.\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n        </description>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t", "<item xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n\t\t\t<title>The future of Flatpak</title>\n\t\t\t<link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1020571/</link>\n\t\t\t<guid>https://lwn.net/Articles/1020571/</guid>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>jzb</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<description>&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=\"https://linuxappsummit.org/\"&gt;Linux Application\nSummit&lt;/a&gt; (LAS) in April, Sebastian Wick said that, by many metrics, &lt;a\nhref=\"https://flatpak.org/\"&gt;Flatpak&lt;/a&gt; is doing great.

While many types of kernel testing can only be done in the\npresence of specific hardware, there are other parts of the kernel\nthat could be more widely tested.  Over time, though, the kernel has gained\ntwo separate testing frameworks and a growing body of automated tests to go\nwith them.  These two frameworks — kselftests and KUnit — take different\napproaches to the testing problem; now &lt;a\nhref=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250626-kunit-kselftests-v4-0-48760534fef5@linutronix.de\"&gt;this\npatch series&lt;/a&gt; from Thomas Weißschuh aims to bring them together.\n</description>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t", "<item xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n\t\t\t<title>LWN.net Weekly Edition for July 17, 2025</title>\n\t\t\t<link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1029426/</link>\n\t\t\t<guid>https://lwn.net/Articles/1029426/</guid>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>corbet</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<description>Inside this week's LWN.net Weekly Edition:\n        &lt;p&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1029426/\"&gt;Front&lt;/a&gt;: Python JIT; Anubis; Secure Boot certificate expiration; SFrame; Exported symbols; Python packaging in Fedora.\n            &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1029428/\"&gt;Briefs&lt;/a&gt;: Parrot 6.4; SPI report; Quotes; ...\n            &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1029429/\"&gt;Announcements&lt;/a&gt;: Newsletters, conferences, security updates, patches, and more. \n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n        </description>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t", "<item xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n\t\t\t<title>Linux and Secure Boot certificate expiration</title>\n\t\t\t<link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1029767/</link>\n\t\t\t<guid>https://lwn.net/Articles/1029767/</guid>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>jake</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<description>Linux users who have &lt;a\nhref=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Secure_Boot\"&gt;Secure Boot&lt;/a&gt;\nenabled on their systems knowingly or unknowingly rely on a key from\nMicrosoft that is set to expire in September.

The situation has also frustrated some\nFedora developers, who would prefer to put Flathub's offerings\nfirst. A new complaint that Fedora has apparently used &lt;a\nhref=\"https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html#manifests\"&gt;manifests&lt;/a&gt;\nfrom Flathub to build the packages for Fedora—without giving credit to\nthe original authors&amp;mdash;has spurred discussions about Fedora's\nFlatpaks once again. While no concrete changes are on the table, yet,\nthere may be some movement toward addressing persistent complaints.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t", "<item xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n\t\t\t<title>LWN.net Weekly Edition for November 13, 2025</title>\n\t\t\t<link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1045243/</link>\n\t\t\t<guid>https://lwn.net/Articles/1045243/</guid>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>jzb</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<description>Inside this week's LWN.net Weekly Edition:\n        &lt;p&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1045243/\"&gt;Front&lt;/a&gt;: FUSE performance; Magic kfuncs; Tails Linux; Direct I/O and modifying buffers; Working with bootable containers.\n            &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1045245/\"&gt;Briefs&lt;/a&gt;: Kernel LLM policy; Firefox 145; FHS; Homebrew 5.0.0; Mastodon 4.5; Public-inbox 2.0.0; Pytest 9.0.0; Quote; ...\n            &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1045246/\"&gt;Announcements&lt;/a&gt;: Newsletters, conferences, security updates, patches, and more.\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n        </description>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t", "<item xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n\t\t\t<title>The intersection of unstable pages and direct I/O</title>\n\t\t\t<link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1045006/</link>\n\t\t\t<guid>https://lwn.net/Articles/1045006/</guid>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>corbet</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<description>Longtime LWN readers will have encountered the concept of \"stable pages\"\nbefore; it was first &lt;a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/429295/\"&gt;covered here&lt;/a&gt; nearly\n15&amp;#160;years ago.

But\nrecent discussions show that there is one area where problems remain:\ndirect &lt;span class=\"nobreak\"&gt;I/O&lt;/span&gt;.

If there are conflicts between\nbranches, the linux-next process will reveal them.  In theory, many other\ntypes of problems can be found as well.  Some developers feel that\nlinux-next does not work as well as it could, though.  At the 2025\nMaintainers Summit, Mark Brown, who helps to keep linux-next going, led a\nsession on how it could be made to work more effectively.\n</description>\n        <pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        ", "<item xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n        <title>Toward a policy for machine-learning tools in kernel development</title>\n        <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1049830/</link>\n        <guid>https://lwn.net/Articles/1049830/</guid>\n        <dc:creator>corbet</dc:creator>\n        <description>The first topic of discussion at the 2025 Maintainers Summit has been in\nthe air for a while: what role — if any — should machine-learning-based\ntools have in the kernel development process?
