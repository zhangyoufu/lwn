      &lt;p&gt;Once again, &lt;a
href=&quot;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc&quot;&gt;runc&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;a tool
for spawning and running OCI containers&amp;mdash;is drawing attention due to a &lt;a

severity container breakout attack&lt;/a&gt;. This vulnerability is interesting for
several reasons: its potential for widespread impact, the continued difficulty
in actually &lt;em&gt;containing&lt;/em&gt; containers, the dangers of running containers
as a privileged user, and the fact that this vulnerability is made possible
in part by a response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/781013/&quot;&gt;a previous
container breakout flaw in runc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      The generation of random (or, at least, unpredictable) numbers is key to
many security technologies.  For this reason, the provision of random data
as a CPU feature has drawn a lot of attention over the years.  A proper
hardware-based random-number generator can address the problems that make
randomness hard to obtain in some systems, but only if the manufacturer can
be trusted to not have compromised that generator in some way.  A recent
discussion has brought to light a different problem, though: what happens
if a hardware random-number generator can be simply driven into exhaustion?

      <title>So you think you understand IP fragmentation?</title>

      <description>
      What is IP fragmentation, why is it important, and do people understand
it? The answer to that last question is &quot;not as well as they think&quot;. This
article will also answer the rest of those
questions and introduce &lt;a
href=&quot;https://valerieaurora.org/fragquiz.html&quot;&gt;fragquiz&lt;/a&gt;, a game that I
wrote to allow players to guess how IP packets will behave when they are
too large for the network. As evidence that IP fragmentation is not
well-understood, a room full of networking experts played fragquiz and got
a score that was
nowhere close to perfect.  In addition, I will describe a new algorithm for
fragmentation avoidance, which some colleagues and I
developed, that helped motivate development of fragquiz.

released version 2.39&lt;/a&gt; on January 31, including
several new features. Notable highlights include new functions for spawning
child processes, support for shadow stacks on x86_64, new security features, and
the removal of libcrypt. The glibc maintainers had also hoped to include
improvements to &lt;tt&gt;qsort()&lt;/tt&gt;, which ended up not making it into this
release. Glibc releases are made every six months.

      <description>
      A common problem in kernel development is controlling &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; a
specific task should be done.  Kernel code often executes in contexts where
some actions (sleeping, for example, or calling into filesystems) are not
possible.  Other actions, while possible, may prevent the kernel from
taking care of a more important task in a timely manner.  The kernel
community has developed a number of deferred-execution mechanisms designed
to ensure that every task is handled at the right time.  One of those
mechanisms, tasklets, has been eyed for removal for years; that removal
might just happen in the near future.

for the language, largely focusing on compiler performance and continuing
progress toward stabilization for the language. He discussed details of his plan
for incremental compilation, and addressed the sustainability of the project in
terms of both code contributions and financial support.

      <description>
      Filesystem development is not an easy task; the performance demands are
typically high, and the consequences for mistakes usually involve lost data
and irate users.  The implementation of a virtual (or &quot;pseudo&quot;) filesystem
â a filesystem implemented within the kernel and lacking a normal backing
store â can also be challenging, but for different reasons.  A series of
conversations around the eventfs virtual filesystem has turned a spotlight
on the difficulty of creating a virtual filesystem for Linux.

      &lt;p&gt;The FreeBSD Project &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-announce/2024-February/000117.html&quot;&gt;has announced that it intends to deprecate 32-bit platforms&lt;/a&gt; &quot;&lt;q&gt;over the next couple of major releases&lt;/q&gt;&quot;. 

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
We anticipate FreeBSD 15.0 will not include the armv6, i386, and powerpc platforms, and FreeBSD 16.0 will not include armv7. Support for executing 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels will be retained through at least the lifetime of the stable/16 branch if not longer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement notes that support for some 32-bit platforms &quot;&lt;q&gt;may be extended if there is both demand and commitment to increased developer resources&lt;/q&gt;&quot;. More details about the current plans for 32-bit platforms are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/releases/14.0R/relnotes/&quot;&gt;in the FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Joseph Gayso wrote &quot;&lt;q&gt;weâve seen more of our mainline Fedora Linux spins make the jump to offer a version that implements rpm-ostree. Itâs reached the point where it can be hard to talk about all of them at the same time. Therefore weâve introduced a new brand that will serve to simplify how we discuss rpm-ostree and how we name future atomic spins.&lt;/q&gt;&quot; LWN &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/954059/&quot;&gt;covered Project Bluefin&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on Fedora's rpm-ostree work, in December 2023.

      <title>DRM-CI: A GitLab-CI pipeline for Linux kernel testing (Collabora Blog)</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/961655/</link>

      <description>
      Over on the Collabora blog, Helen Koike &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2024/02/08/drm-ci-a-gitlab-ci-pipeline-for-linux-kernel-testing/&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;
about the DRM-CI project for running automated continuous integration (CI)
tests on multiple graphics devices in several different labs.  It uses the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/igt-gpu-tools&quot;&gt;IGT GPU
tools&lt;/a&gt; for testing, though there are plans to expand:
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
The roadmap for DRM-CI includes enabling other devices, incorporating
additional tests like kselftests, adding support for vgem driver, and
implementing further automations. DRM-CI builds upon the groundwork laid by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/&quot;&gt;Mesa3D CI&lt;/a&gt;,
including its GitLab YAML files and most of its setup, fostering 
collaboration and mutual strengthening.
&lt;p&gt;
[...] Adapting the DRM-CI pipeline to other subsystems is feasible with a
few modifications. The primary consideration is setting up dedicated
GitLab-CI runners since Freedesktop's infrastructure is meant only for
graphics. 
&lt;p&gt;
In light of this, our team is developing a versatile and user-friendly
GitLab-CI pipeline. This new pipeline is envisioned to function as a
flexible interface for kernel maintainers and developers that can be
evolved to connect with different test environments that can also be hooked
with CI systems such as KernelCI. This approach aims to simplify the
integration process, making GitLab-CI more accessible and beneficial to a
broader range of developers.

      David Rowley &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2024/02/08/whats-new-in-postgres-16-query-planner-optimizer/&quot;&gt;looks
deeply&lt;/a&gt; into the improvements coming to the query planner in
PostgreSQL&amp;nbsp;16.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	For a long time now, PostgreSQL has been able to remove a &lt;tt&gt;LEFT JOIN&lt;/tt&gt;
	where no column from the left joined table was required in the
	query and the join could not possibly duplicate any rows.
&lt;p&gt;
	However, in versions prior to PostgreSQL 16, there was no support
	for left join removals on partitioned tables. Why? Because the
	proofs that the planner uses to determine if thereâs any
	possibility any inner-side row could duplicate any outer-side row
	were not present for partitioned tables.
&lt;p&gt;
	The PostgreSQL 16 query planner now allows the LEFT JOIN removal
	optimization with partitioned tables.

	memory; they contain plenty of extra metadata which is critical to
	understanding their contents. And like any other type of data, the
	design of the file formats can enable lots of flexibility and
	power. However, due to the broad variety of tools out there, the
	diversity of dump formats is overwhelming, and the lack of
	documentation or specifications compounds the problem.

      Mitchell Baker has &lt;a
href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/a-new-chapter-for-mozilla-laura-chambers-expanded-role/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;
that she is stepping down from the role of Mozilla CEO, effective
immediately.  Laura Chambers will be the new CEO &quot;&lt;q&gt;for the remainder of
the year&lt;/q&gt;&quot;.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	Weâre at a critical juncture where public trust in institutions,
	governments, and the fabric of the internet has reached
	unprecedented lows. Thereâs a tectonic shift underway as everyone
	battles to own the future of AI. It is Mozillaâs opportunity and
	imperative to forge a better future. Iâm excited about Lauraâs
	day-to-day involvement and the chance for Mozilla to achieve
	more. Our power lies in the collective effort of people
	contributing to something better and Iâm eager for Mozilla to meet
	the needs of this era more fully.

      The GNU C Library project &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/oss-security/ec94d28c-dbf4-4506-98e3-313c38ae15d5@redhat.com/&quot;&gt;has
been accepted&lt;/a&gt; as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), meaning that the
project is now in control of the CVE numbers assigned to its code.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	As a CNA the glibc security team will be working to improve the
	quality and response time of security advisories and mitigations.
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the coming months, the glibc security team will define the
	process for the CNA and establish best practices that can also be
	used by the rest of the GNU Toolchain.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/945536/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for some background on
this change.
